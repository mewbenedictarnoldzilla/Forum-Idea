# Forum-Idea

#This is an idea for a Science Forum that I came up with (actually, it was around 100% Kyle give or take), and it is meant to be a rip-off of Wikipedia's Science-related section (basically). There are three main repositories, but you can fork them, make your own, comment, etc. You can make an essay for a comment or a repository, or you can do a small essay and use animations to make it more interesting and understandable, which you can do with desmos or a built-in animation maker. Which might not work. Anyways, you can also get banned and that's the main thing. Hope you don't hate it.
